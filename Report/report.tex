		\begin{abstract}
			For part 1 of the coursework required for the SET10108 Concurrent and Parallel Systems module at Edinburgh Napier University a ray tracing algorithm's performance was to be evaluated and improved by utilising parallel techniques. This report documents one such investigation where the algorithm was parallelised and the difference in its	 performance was measured.

	\section{Introduction and Background}
	
	\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} aim of this report is to evaluate the performance of a ray tracing algorithm and attempt to improve this performance using parallel techniques. The ray tracer initially processes sequentially on a single core of the CPU, but by investigating different parallel techniques the algorithm was changed to run on multiple threads in an attempt to increase the performance.
	
	\subsection{Ray Tracer}
	Ray tracing is a technique used to render an image where "a ray is cast through every pixel of the image, tracing the light coming from that direction" \cite{ray}. The path is traced from an imaginary eye through each pixel on a virtual image plane and the colour of the object visible through it is calculated. It is typically capable of producing visually realistic images of high quality but at a greater computational cost compared to typical rendering techniques. Therefore it tends to be used when an image can be generated slowly ahead of time, but isn't so well suited to the real-time rendering requirements of video games.
