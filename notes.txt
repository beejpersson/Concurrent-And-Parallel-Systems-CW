CW1 Notes

Testing notes:
 - speedup
 - efficiency
 
 Image dimension constant (256), samples per pixel variable:
		- 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
		
Samples per pixel constant (16), image dimension variable:
		- 128, 256, 512, 1024


Large sample / image tests -> seq vs par

Do more parallel methods, determine best speed up, more tests with that one
